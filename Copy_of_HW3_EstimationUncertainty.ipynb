Suppose that we draw some random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ from some distribution with mean $\\mu$ and compute the mean $\\bar{X}$, which we expect to be close to but not exactly equal to the true mean $\\mu$. The LLN and CLT state the following:\n",

Imagine that we have a (not necessarily fair) coin that comes up heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability $1-p$. We can do an \"experiment\" in which we flip the coin $n$ times and let $X_i = 1$ if it comes up heads or $X_i = 0$ if it comes up tails on the $i$th flip. We can say that $Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is a random variable drawn from a binomial distribution $\\mathcal{B}(n,p)$."

If $p$ is the probability that the coin comes up heads, we can simulate a coin flip by saying that the result is heads if `np.random.rand()` $< p$, and tails otherwise. (Think this through to make sure that it makes sense!) Then, if we want to generate a binomial random variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{B}(n,p)$, we just need to do this $n$ times and add up the number of heads flips.\n",

This is the crucial point about the CLT: If $n$ is large, then distributions of *means* are normal, even if the distribution from which the data is drawn is not normal. This is very important to keep in mind with experimental data, where the CLT means that we can still know something about the distribution of means, even if we don't know the underlying distribution from which the data is drawn.\n",

        "When fitting a statistical model (for example, a normal distribution to describe a collection of data points, or a linear fit to describe the relation between two sets of data) to data, we want to optimize the parameters of the fit. Maximum likelihood (ML) gives us a way to do this. According to ML, we should write think of our data $x$ as coming from a probability distribution $p(x|\\theta)$ that depends on parameter $\\theta$ (which could be, for example, the mean $\\mu$ or variance $\\sigma^2$ in a normal distribution). The best value of $\\theta$ is then the one that maximizes this probability distribution. In practice, we actually maximize $\\ln(p(x|\\theta))$ rather than $p(x|\\theta)$ itself. We do this because it is easier mathematically, and, since the logarithm always increases when its argument increases, we can be sure that the $\\theta$ that maximizes $p(x|\\theta)$ will also maximize $\\ln(p(x|\\theta))$."

If we count an occurrence of heads in flip $i$ as $X_i=1$ and tails as $X_i=0$, then the outcome of our experiment is a random variable $Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, which is described by a binomial distribution: $Y \\sim \\mathcal{B}(n,p)$, where $p$ is the true probability of a given flip coming up heads.\n",

The standard error then comes from calculating the variance of this quantity, which we showed in class is $Var(Y/n) = p(1-p)/n$. The standard error is given by the square root of this variance, but with $p$ replaced by our estimate $\\hat{p}$ since we don't know the true value of $p$, giving $\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n}$."

If we could repeat our experiment many times and calculate the confidence interval for each experiment, the interval would include, or \"cover\", the true value of $p$ most of the time (we'll show exactly how often below). (Note that, as we discussed in class, this is slightly different from saying that the true value of $p$ lies inside our confidence interval with a certain probability--a common misinterpretation!) We can also note that the confidence interval becomes smaller as $n$ grows larger, which tells us that we get a better estimate of $p$ as we do more coin flips.\n",

If, for example, we have a large number of data points $n$ so that the CLT applies, then it is possible to show that the interval $[\\hat{p}-2\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}), \\hat{p}+2\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})]$ is expected to cover the true value of $p$ 95% of the time.

Also change the confidence interval to $[\\hat{p}-2\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}), \\hat{p}+2\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})]$. Show that the fraction of experiments in which the confidence interval covers the true value of $p$ is very close to 0.95. This illustrates the \"95% rule\", which states that, for data that comes from a normal distribution, 95% of the probability is within two standard deviations of the mean. Hence, for a given experiment of $n$ coin flips, we can refer to the range $[\\hat{p}-2\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}), \\hat{p}+2\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})]$ as the \"95% confidence interval\"."

In what fraction of the experiments is $\\hat{p}$ greater than or equal to the value that you computed above for the patient? This is an example of a \"p value\" (sorry, this p is different from the other one--p means lots of different things in statistics!). If the p value is small (conventionally, smaller than 0.05 is considered to be significant), this tells us that the observed data is likely to be inconsistent with the statistical model, allowing us to \"reject the null hypothesis\". The idea of a p value is very important, since it is the typical way that experimental conclusions are stated. We'll learn more about them in the next homework assignment."
